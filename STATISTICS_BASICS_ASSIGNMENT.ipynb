        " Interval Scale:The interval scale is a level of measurement where the data can be ordered, and the differences between values are meaningful and consistent. However, the scale does not have a true zero point (i.e., zero does not represent the absence of the property being measured).\n",

It has all the properties of the interval scale, but it also includes a true zero point, which indicates the absence of the property being measured.

        "\n",
        "Dispersion refers to the extent to which data points in a dataset differ from the central value (mean or median). It is a measure of how spread out the values in a data set are. In other words, dispersion tells you how much variability or diversity exists in the data. Understanding dispersion helps in interpreting the reliability of the central tendency (like the mean) and provides insights into the consistency or variability of the dataset.\n",

        "Variance\n",
        "\n",
        "Variance measures the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean. It quantifies how much the values in a dataset deviate from the mean on average.

        "A box plot (also known as a box-and-whisker plot) is a graphical representation of a dataset that displays its distribution, central tendency, and variability.

        "\n",
        "Random sampling is a crucial technique in statistics for drawing valid inferences about a population based on data collected from a subset (sample) of that population. The role of random sampling is to ensure that the sample is representative of the population, reducing bias and enabling more reliable and accurate generalizations or conclusions to be made about the population.\n",

        "\n",
        "Skewness is a statistical measure that describes the asymmetry or deviation from symmetry in the distribution of data. In other words, it tells us whether the data is skewed to the left (negatively skewed) or skewed to the right (positively skewed) when compared to a normal distribution, which is perfectly symmetrical. Skewness provides insights into the shape of the data distribution and helps interpret data characteristics beyond just central tendency (mean, median, mode).\n",
